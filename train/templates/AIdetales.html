    <h2>Details of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. It encompasses a wide range of techniques and approaches aimed at enabling machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and natural language understanding.</p>
    <p>AI systems rely on various technologies, including machine learning, neural networks, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and robotics. These technologies enable AI systems to analyze vast amounts of data, recognize patterns, make predictions, and adapt to changing environments.</p>
    <p>AI finds applications across numerous domains, including healthcare, finance, transportation, manufacturing, education, entertainment, and more. In healthcare, AI is used for medical diagnosis, personalized treatment planning, drug discovery, and patient monitoring. In finance, AI powers algorithmic trading, fraud detection, risk assessment, and customer service automation.</p>
    <p>While AI offers immense potential for innovation and efficiency, it also raises ethical and societal concerns, such as job displacement, bias in algorithms, privacy issues, and the potential for autonomous systems to make harmful decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to approach the development and deployment of AI technologies with careful consideration of these implications to ensure a responsible and beneficial integration into society.</p>
